  === GIT COMMIT TEMPLATE ===
  <type>(<scope>): <subject>

  [Motivation]:
  - Why is this change necessary?
  - Prior behavior / issue.

  [Testing]:
  - [ ] Manual – steps/results:
  - [ ] Unit – tests added/updated:
  - [ ] Integration – scenarios covered:

  [Issues]:
  - Fixes/Closes/Resolves #<id> (optional)

  [BreakingChange]:
  - BREAKING CHANGE: <details> (optional)

  [Metadata]:
  - <Any extra automation/CI metadata> (optional)

  Notes:

  - Header line stays Conventional Commit compliant (type + optional scope + imperative subject).
  - Each structured body section still begins with the [KEY]: marker for straightforward parsing.
  - Prompt-style bullet hints ensure the author actually includes the expected detail without bloating the template.
  - Testing section keeps the checkbox cues but prompts for short descriptions so the AI gets context, not just a “Yes/No”.
  - Footer clearly separates issues/breaking changes/metadata; authors can delete unused blocks.
